    <h2>Description</h2>
   <p>
   There are various recipes of chicken, but we shall be talking about <b><i>Roasted Chicken</i></b> only for now. <br>
   Roast chicken is chicken prepared as food by roasting whether in a home kitchen, over a fire, or with a rotisserie.
   </p>
   
   <h2>Ingredients</h2>
   <ul>
    <li>One 2- to 3-pound farm-raised chicken</li>
    <li>Salt and freshly ground black pepper</li>
    <li>2 tsp. minced thyme (optional)</li>
    <li>Unsalted butter</li>
    <li>Dijon mustard</li>
   </ul>
   <h2>Steps</h2>
   <ol>
    <li>Preheat the oven to 450°F. Rinse the chicken, then dry it very well with paper towels, inside and out. The less it steams, the drier the heat, the better.</li>
    <li>Salt and pepper the cavity, then truss the bird. Trussing is not difficult, and if you roast chicken often, it is a good technique to feel comfortable with. When you truss a bird, the wings and legs stay close to the body; the ends of the drumsticks cover the top of the breast and keep it from drying out. Trussing helps the chicken to cook evenly, and it also makes for a more beautiful roasted bird.</li>
    <li>Now, salt the chicken—I like to rain the salt over the bird so that it has a nice uniform coating that will result in a crisp, salty, flavorful skin (about 1 Tbsp.). When it is cooked, you should still be able to make out the salt baked onto the crisp skin. Season to taste with pepper.</li>
    <li>Place the chicken breast side up in a sauté pan or roasting pan and, when the oven is up to temperature, put the chicken in the oven. Leave it alone—do not baste it, do not add butter; you can if you wish, but I feel this creates steam, which I do not want. Roast it until it is done, 50 to 60 minutes. Remove it from the oven and add the thyme, if using, to the pan. Baste the chicken with the pan juices and thyme and let it rest for 15 minutes on a cutting board.</li>
    <li>Remove the twine. Separate the middle wing joint and eat that immediately. Remove the legs and thighs. Serve with mustard on the side and, if you wish, a simple green salad.</li>
