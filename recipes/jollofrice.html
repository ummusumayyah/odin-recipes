    <li>½ medium Scotch bonnet pepper (or use a habanero pepper), stem remove</li>
    <li>½ medium onion, roughly chopped</li>
    <li>3 small red bell peppers, roughly chopped (about 5 ounces each)</li>
    <li>½ cup vegetable oil</li>
    <li>1½ teaspoons salt</li>
    <li>1 teaspoon curry powder</li>
    <li>1½ teaspoons hot ground chile pepper, such as African dried chile or cayenne</li>
    <li>1½ teaspoons garlic powder</li>
    <li>1 tablespoon plus 1 heaping teaspoon onion powder</li>
    <li>2 bay leaves</li>
    <li>½ teaspoon ground ginger</li>
    <li>1 tablespoon dried thyme</li>
    <li>2½ cups medium-grain rice</li>
   </ul>
   <h2>Steps</h2>
   <ol>
    <li>In a blender, combine tomatoes, scotch bonnet pepper and onions; purée. <br>
         Pour out half the purée into a bowl; set aside. <br> 
         Add the bell peppers to the purée remaining in the blender and pulse until smooth. <br> 
         Add to the mixture that was set aside and stir to combine. </li>
   <li>Heat vegetable oil in a large pot over medium heat. <br> 
    Add blended vegetables along with the salt, curry powder, ground chile pepper, garlic powder, onion powder, bay leaves, ginger and thyme. <br>
     Bring mixture to a boil.</li>
    <li>Stir in the rice until well mixed, then reduce the heat to low.</li>
    <li>Cover pot and let cook until rice is al dente, about 45 minutes. <br> 
        Check after 30 minutes; if rice is sauce-logged, remove the lid to cook off the excess sauce. <br>
         If rice seems dry, stir in 1 to 2 cups water. <br>
         Allow the rice at the bottom of the pot to char a bit to infuse it with a smoky flavor.</li>
